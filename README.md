## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This is BarCard, a site that lets bartenders and mixologists share their bar recipies and learn from one another. This is by group 13. Project #2.

## Project Process

Our group used everything we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application to showcase to potential employers.
Here are some examples of what was used in the site!

- We used Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Used Handlebars.js as a template engine for dynamic HTML.

- Programs such as MySQL and the Sequelize ORM were used for the database.

- We have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- We have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- The site includes authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Heroku was used to depoly the site (with data).

- The UI is polished.

- We made sure the site is responsive throughout.

- While being responsive it is also interactive for the user.
